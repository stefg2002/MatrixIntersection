# MatrixIntersection
C program that finds the intersection of two matrices.

User enters the dimensions of the first matrix(i.e '2 3' represents a 2x3 matrix).
Then the user enters the elements of that matrix. Each column is seperated by a space and each row is on a new line.
Program repeats for the second array.
